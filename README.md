# bitcoin_price_api

The bitcoin_price_api has been developed on NodeJS. It fetches bitcoin prices  every hour (configurable) from coinapi and stores them in a history-table in MongoDB database.
Get APIs are available to fetch history data of different types, ie, day, month, year, all etc.

The API can be starting using command:
npm install (to install dependencies first-time)
node server.js
